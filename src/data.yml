        subtitle: An ideal future for territories 
        content: We envision territories as sustainable organisations taking a changemaker position in order to limit the loss and centralisation of territorial values. We see territories (old villages, rural areas, suburban neighborhoods) as community enterprises where local people can acquire the required entrepreneurial skills to face future challenges, where diverse stakeholders participate in the social, economic and environmental development and where education, technology and economy are used to enable the desired transformation.
